<h1>Inspiration</h1>
My main goal for this project was to practice and get comfortable with using Tailwind CSS. I was already a fan of using inline styles so I wanted to learn this framework as they are quiet similiar. The idea for the project was simple. I wanted somewhere to keep track of my favourite coffee shops.

<h1>Summary</h1>
I was very happy with how this project went. I learned a lot about Tailwind and I will definitely continue to use it for styling as it is very fast and simple to use.
I may add more features in this app in time as I feel it has a lot of potential to be something much bigger. Maybe I'll eventually build a backend and add a feed with other users.
